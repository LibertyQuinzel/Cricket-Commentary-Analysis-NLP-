The first replay is slightly blurry, we'll need the zoomer, it does come and it does look like the ball went straight into Siraj's palms. But umpire Marais Erasmus wants to have a few more looks, he's going back and forth with the angles. Will Crawley get away with the benefit of doubts? No, OUT is the call. India are slicing through England's top-order now - Crawley was looking to be positive against spin, doesn't get to the pitch of the ball and chipped it in the air.
